Here you can find the neccessary Packages and Assets. As long as the files are in the same directory with All DriveSmart file and packages and assets, anybody can run the project. In order to run the project, you should download packages and  assets (which I cannot upload on Github as they are very big (3GBs)) and place them in the same directory.

Or you can also download the full file with all the neccessary files at once and just run.
